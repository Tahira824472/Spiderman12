            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I made the saying, "With great power comes tremendous responsibility," popular.
                <br>
                After being bitten by a radioactive spider, I developed superhuman spider-related 
                <br>
                skills, such as the ability to cling to surfaces, as well as superhuman strength, speed, 
                <br>
                and agility, as well as the ability to smell danger.
            </p>
                <br> 
                <p1>
                    I also created "web-shooters" that attach to the wrist and fire custom-made 
                    <br>
                    artificial spiderwebs. I am good at it.

                <h5>Power</h5>
                <p2>IÂ possess superhuman strength, agility, endurance,
                    <br> 
                    the ability to stick to and climb walls and other 
                    <br>
                    surfaces, the ability to shoot and swing from sticky 
                    <br>
                    webs using self-designed web-shooters, a unique sense 
                    <br>
                    known as "Spider-Sense," and a brilliant mind with a 
                    <br>
                    focus on creation and chemistry.

            <h5>Weakness</h5>
            <p3>Ethyl chloride is a major weakness that negates his abilities.
                <br>
                This chemical isn't nearly as well recognized as other power-cancellers,
                <br>
                like Superman's Kryptonite, despite its undeniable impact on the web-slinger.</p3>

            <h5>Strength</h5>
            <br><br>
            <p4>Mighty power Similar to his namesake, Spider-Man is much stronger 
                <br>
                and more agile than the typical person, which enables him to lift 
                <br>
                almost ten tons, leap extremely high, and move with pinpoint accuracy
                <br>
                at great speeds.</p4>
